/**
 * Abstraction for timed-event series that helps with variable frame-rates. Useful for things that need to happen at a
 * specific rate real-time regardless of the frame-rate.
 *
 * An EventTimer is created with a specific event "model" that determines when events occur, and a callback that will
 * be triggered for each event (with its time elapsed since it should have occurred). Thus, each callback basically
 * says:
 * - "an event happened <timeElapsed> ago"
 *
 * To have the EventTimer step forward in time (firing callbacks for every event that would have occurred over that
 * time frame, if any), call step( realTimeElapsed ).
 *
 * -----------------------------------------
 *
 * For example, create a timer with a constant rate that will fire events every 1 time units:
 *
 * var timer = new phetCore.EventTimer( new phetCore.EventTimer.ConstantEventModel( 1 ), function( timeElapsed ) {
 *   console.log( 'event with timeElapsed: ' + timeElapsed );
 * } );
 *
 * Stepping once for 1.5 time units will fire once (0.5 seconds since the "end" of the step), and will be 0.5 seconds
 * from the next step:
 *
 * timer.step( 1.5 );
 * > event with timeElapsed: 0.5
 *
 * The 0.5 above is because after 1.5 seconds of time, the event will have happened 0.5 seconds ago:
 *
 *           step 1.5
 * |------------------------>|
 * |                *        |          *                     *    <- constant time of 1 between each event
 * |                <--------|
 *                 0.5 seconds past the event now
 *
 * Stepping for a longer time will result in more events:
 *
 * timer.step( 6 );
 * > event with timeElapsed: 5.5
 * > event with timeElapsed: 4.5
 * > event with timeElapsed: 3.5
 * > event with timeElapsed: 2.5
 * > event with timeElapsed: 1.5
 * > event with timeElapsed: 0.5
 *
 *       step 1.5                                  step 6                                 step 0   step 1.5
 * |---------------->|---------------------------------------------------------------------->|---------------->|
 * |           *           *           *           *           *           *           *           *           *
 * |           <-----|     <-----------------------------------------------------------------|     <-----------|
 * |          0.5         5.5          <-----------------------------------------------------|     1           0
 * |           ^           ^          4.5          <-----------------------------------------|              event at
 * |           |           |                      3.5          <-----------------------------|              current
 * |           |           |                                  2.5          <-----------------|              time
 * |     callback( t ) called, etc.                                       1.5          <-----|
 * |
 *
 * A step with zero time will trigger no events:
 *
 * timer.step( 0 );
 *
 * The timer will fire an event once it reaches the exact point in time:
 *
 * timer.step( 1.5 );
 * > event with timeElapsed: 1
 * > event with timeElapsed: 0
 *
 * NOTE:
 * If your timer callbacks create model objects that would also get stepped forward, make sure to step forward objects
 * before calling eventTimer.step(), so that objects don't get stepped twice. Usually the callback will have:
 * - var modelElement = new ModelElement();
 * - modelElement.step( callbackTimeElapsed );
 * And you don't want to apply step( dt ) to it directly afterwards.
